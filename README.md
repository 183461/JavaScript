# JavaScript
FullStack Steps 

Hi, this read me is about the projects I made during my JavaScript Learning and Self Improvement stage.

You can see which methods, techniques, and approaches I applied to my coding. 

I will create another repository for the projects I will use JS with other languages. 

Have fun!!
